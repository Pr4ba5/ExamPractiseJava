Practice Q2
Simulate a basic login system for a company’s internal mail service. The system checks:
• If the email ID is valid.
• If the password is correct.
Your program should:
• Store sample email-password pairs (e.g., user01@org.com → hello123).
• Take input and validate credentials.
• Use InvalidEmailException if the email is unknown.
• Use WrongCredentialsException if the password is incorrect.
• Catch and display helpful error messages to the user.
